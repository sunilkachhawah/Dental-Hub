<p><h1> Dentist  Management Application </h1></p>

<p> <p><h3> Work completed : </h3><p>This is an android application designed to fulfill the needs of appointment booking and other medical services. </p>
This app contains user authentication service from firebase , Booking Service with different timing slots and successful notification upon booking. The contact us page takes directly to the email app.
<p> </p>

<p> <p> <h3>Work in progress :</h3> The home delivery of medicine and the my booking section part has not yet been implemented.The appointments that are booked by a user (say A) are not visible to user (A) and thus the viewing of the respective user's appointment has to be implemented, both future and past appointments. The user is not given flexibilty to update his account which will be added in coming updates. The doctor password change is not yet implemented due to trial version constraints. Anyone interested to contribute can oen a pull request for the bugs and the remaining works. The updated app will be pushed to playstore in coming few weeks. </p></p>
<p> Thank You </p>
